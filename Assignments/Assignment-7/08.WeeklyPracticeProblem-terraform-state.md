### Assignment: Understanding Terraform State File and State Commands

In this assignment, you will explore the Terraform state file and learn how to use the `terraform state list` and `terraform refresh` commands. You will work through three scenarios to understand how these commands interact with changes in your infrastructure.

#### Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of Terraform
- Access to a cloud provider (e.g., Azure) and Terraform installed
- A Terraform configuration managing at least one resource group (RG)

#### Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Adding a New Resource Group

1. **Update the Configuration**:
   - Add a new resource group (RG) to your existing Terraform configuration.

   ```hcl
   resource "azurerm_resource_group" "new_rg" {
     name     = "NewResourceGroup"
     location = "East US"
   }
   ```

2. **Run Terraform Commands**:
   - Run `terraform plan` to see the planned addition.
   - Run `terraform apply` to create the new resource group.

3. **Verify State File**:
   - Run `terraform state list` to list all resources in the state file.
   - Run `terraform state show azurerm_resource_group.new_rg` to view details of the new resource group.
   - Run `terraform refresh` to ensure the state file is up to date.

4. **Questions**:
   - What changes did you observe in the state file after adding the new resource group?
   - What did the `terraform state list` command output after applying the new resource group?
   - Why is it important to run `terraform refresh` after making changes?

### Scenario 2: Deleting a Resource Group in the Code

1. **Update the Configuration**:
   - Remove an existing resource group (RG) from your Terraform configuration.

   ```hcl
   # Remove the block defining an existing RG
   # resource "azurerm_resource_group" "existing_rg" {
   #   name     = "ExistingResourceGroup"
   #   location = "East US"
   # }
   ```

2. **Run Terraform Commands**:
   - Run `terraform plan` to see the planned deletion.
   - Run `terraform apply` to delete the resource group.

3. **Verify State File**:
   - Run `terraform state list` to list all resources in the state file.
   - Run `terraform state show azurerm_resource_group.existing_rg` to confirm it has been removed (it should show an error if it was correctly removed).
   - Run `terraform refresh` to ensure the state file is up to date.

4. **Questions**:
   - What changes did you observe in the state file after removing the resource group from the configuration?
   - What did the `terraform state list` command output after applying the deletion?
   - How does `terraform refresh` help in maintaining the state file’s accuracy?

### Scenario 3: Deleting a Resource Group from the Portal

1. **Manual Deletion**:
   - Manually delete a resource group (RG) from the cloud provider’s portal.

2. **Run Terraform Commands**:
   - Run `terraform plan` to identify the discrepancy between the state file and the actual state.
   - Run `terraform apply` to address the discrepancy as per your configuration.
   - Run `terraform refresh` to update the state file to reflect the manual deletion.

3. **Verify State File**:
   - Run `terraform state list` to list all resources in the state file.
   - Run `terraform state show azurerm_resource_group.manual_rg` to verify its status.

4. **Questions**:
   - What discrepancy did you observe when running `terraform plan` after manually deleting the resource group?
   - What actions did `terraform apply` take to resolve the discrepancy?
   - How did `terraform refresh` help to synchronize the state file with the actual state of resources?

### Submission

- Provide a brief report detailing your observations and answers to the questions for each scenario.
- Include screenshots of your terminal showing the output of the Terraform commands for each scenario.
- Submit your report and screenshots via the designated submission platform.

### Grading Criteria

- **Accuracy**: Correctly executing the Terraform commands and observing the state changes.
- **Understanding**: Clear and accurate explanations of what happens in each scenario.
- **Presentation**: Well-organized and clear report with relevant screenshots.
