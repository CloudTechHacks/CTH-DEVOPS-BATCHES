### Explanation

#### Root Directory
The root directory contains two main subdirectories: `modules` and `environment`.

#### Modules Directory
The `modules` directory contains reusable Terraform modules. A Terraform module is a collection of Terraform configuration files that are managed as a group. Each module typically includes the necessary Terraform configuration files (`main.tf`, `variables.tf`, `outputs.tf`, etc.) to define a specific resource or set of resources. Using modules helps to organize and reuse code across different environments and projects.

- **azurerm_resource_group/**: 
  - **Purpose**: This module is responsible for creating and managing Azure Resource Groups.
  - **Files**:
    - `main.tf`: Defines the resource group resource.
    - `variables.tf`: Declares variables used in the module, such as the resource group name and location.
    - `outputs.tf`: Defines output values that can be used by other modules or configurations.

- **azurerm_storage_account/**: 
  - **Purpose**: This module is responsible for creating and managing Azure Storage Accounts.
  - **Files**:
    - `main.tf`: Defines the storage account resource.
    - `variables.tf`: Declares variables used in the module, such as the storage account name, resource group, and account tier.
    - `outputs.tf`: Defines output values, such as the storage account name and primary access key.

- **...**: This represents other modules that you might have, such as `azurerm_virtual_network`, `azurerm_subnet`, etc. Each subdirectory here is a self-contained module for a specific Azure resource or set of resources.

#### Environment Directory
The `environment` directory contains environment-specific Terraform configurations. These configurations use the reusable modules defined in the `modules` directory to create and manage resources for specific environments, such as development (`dev`) and production (`prod`).

- **dev/**: 
  - **Purpose**: Contains the Terraform configuration files specific to the development environment.
  - **Files**:
    - `main.tf`: Uses modules from the `modules` directory to define resources for the development environment. For example, it might call the `azurerm_resource_group` and `azurerm_storage_account` modules to create a resource group and storage account for development.
    - `variables.tf`: Declares environment-specific variables.
    - `terraform.tfvars`: Provides values for the declared variables, specific to the development environment.

- **prod/**: 
  - **Purpose**: Contains the Terraform configuration files specific to the production environment.
  - **Files**:
    - `main.tf`: Uses modules from the `modules` directory to define resources for the production environment. For example, it might call the `azurerm_resource_group` and `azurerm_storage_account` modules to create a resource group and storage account for production.
    - `variables.tf`: Declares environment-specific variables.
    - `terraform.tfvars`: Provides values for the declared variables, specific to the production environment.

- **...**: This represents other environments you might have, such as `staging`, `test`, etc. Each subdirectory here contains the Terraform configuration files specific to that environment.

### Benefits of Using Terraform Modules
- **Reusability**: Modules allow you to reuse code across different environments and projects, reducing duplication and increasing consistency.
- **Maintainability**: Changes to a module can be made in one place and propagated to all configurations that use the module.
- **Organization**: Modules help to organize Terraform configuration files, making the structure more manageable and understandable.
- **Scalability**: As your infrastructure grows, modules make it easier to scale by reusing existing code and focusing on higher-level configurations.
