## Providers in Deep: azurerm Provider

**What are Providers?**
Providers are plugins that interact with APIs of service providers to manage and provision infrastructure resources. They are responsible for understanding API interactions and exposing resources within Terraform.

**AzureRM Provider (azurerm)**
The Azure Resource Manager (AzureRM) provider is a Terraform plugin that allows users to manage Azure resources. It interacts with Azure Resource Manager APIs to create, manage, and delete resources like virtual machines, storage accounts, and network interfaces.

**Key Concepts of AzureRM Provider:**
- **Configuration:** Setting up the provider requires specifying necessary credentials and settings to authenticate with Azure.
- **Resources:** Azure resources such as Virtual Machines, Resource Groups, Storage Accounts, etc., that can be managed through Terraform.
- **Data Sources:** Allows querying existing resources and using the data for other configurations.

## Terraform Blocks and Basic Blocks

**What are Blocks in Terraform?**
Blocks are the primary components in Terraform configurations. They define various aspects of the infrastructure and the logic that Terraform should execute. Each block starts with a keyword and contains nested arguments and expressions.

**Basic Blocks in Terraform:**
1. **terraform**: Configures settings related to the Terraform project itself, such as required providers and version constraints.
   
   ```hcl
   terraform {
     required_providers {
       azurerm = {
         source  = "hashicorp/azurerm"
         version = "3.108.0"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. **provider**: Specifies the provider configurations, defining how to connect to the infrastructure provider.

   ```hcl
   provider "azurerm" {
     features {}
   }
   ```

3. **resource**: Defines an infrastructure object, such as a virtual machine, storage account, or database instance.

   ```hcl
   resource "azurerm_resource_group" "rg-block-name" {
     name     = "chulbul-rg"
     location = "West Europe"
   }
   ```

4. **variable**: Defines a variable that can be used to parameterize Terraform configurations.

   ```hcl
   variable "resource_group_name" {
     description = "The name of the resource group"
     type        = string
   }
   ```

5. **output**: Defines output values that can be queried or used by other configurations.

   ```hcl
   output "resource_group_name" {
     value = azurerm_resource_group.rg-block-name.name
   }
   ```

## Code Explanation

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    azurerm = {
      source  = "hashicorp/azurerm"
      version = "3.108.0"
    }
  }
}
```
- **terraform {}**: Defines settings for the Terraform project.
- **required_providers {}**: Specifies providers needed by the configuration.
- **azurerm**: Defines the AzureRM provider.
- **source**: Indicates the provider source, which is "hashicorp/azurerm".
- **version**: Specifies the version of the provider to use.

```hcl
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}
```
- **provider "azurerm" {}**: Configures the AzureRM provider.
- **features {}**: Required by the provider block for AzureRM, even if it is empty.

```hcl
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "rg-block-name" {
  name     = "chulbul-rg"
  location = "West Europe"
}
```
- **resource "azurerm_resource_group" "rg-block-name" {}**: Defines a new Azure Resource Group.
- **name**: Specifies the name of the resource group, "chulbul-rg".
- **location**: Specifies the location of the resource group, "West Europe".

```hcl
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "rg-block-bulbul" {
  name     = "bulbul-rg"
  location = "West Europe"
}
```
- **resource "azurerm_resource_group" "rg-block-bulbul" {}**: Defines another Azure Resource Group.
- **name**: Specifies the name of the resource group, "bulbul-rg".
- **location**: Specifies the location of the resource group, "West Europe".

## Terraform Commands

1. **terraform init**
   - Initializes a new or existing Terraform configuration.
   - Downloads necessary provider plugins and sets up the working directory.

2. **terraform validate**
   - Validates the Terraform configuration files.
   - Checks for syntax errors and logical inconsistencies.

3. **terraform fmt**
   - Formats the Terraform configuration files.
   - Ensures consistency in style and layout.

4. **terraform plan**
   - Creates an execution plan, showing what actions Terraform will take to achieve the desired state.
   - Helps review changes before applying them.

5. **terraform apply**
   - Applies the changes required to reach the desired state of the configuration.
   - Executes the actions proposed by the `terraform plan` command.
